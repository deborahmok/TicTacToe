A program that implements an NxN tic-tac-toe (aka crosses-and-noughts) game. It displays the game progress at each turn (a 3x3 version is shown below) and determine a winner or draws. In addition, there is a code that imitates an action of a basic “AI-bot” that can choose a location for the current player for the best position to win the game. And there is another code for a “Random-bot” that can choose a location for the current player.
